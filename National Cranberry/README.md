# 🍒 National Cranberry Cooperative Case Study Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains an in-depth **operations and process analysis of the National Cranberry Cooperative (NCC)**. The analysis focuses on **capacity bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and improvement recommendations** for Receiving Plant #1 (RP1).  

The analysis is based on the case study:  
**"National Cranberry Cooperative, 1996" – Harvard Business School Case by J. Tucker.**

## 🎯 Case Study Summary  
The **National Cranberry Cooperative (NCC)** is a **grower-owned cooperative** responsible for processing and marketing cranberries. RP1, one of its processing plants, faces **operational inefficiencies leading to bottlenecks, excessive truck wait times, and high labor costs**.  

The primary challenges analyzed in this study include:  
- **Bottlenecks in Drying Operations**: Limited drying capacity for wet berries (600 bbl/hr) despite higher separator capacity (1,200 bbl/hr).  
- **Truck Unloading Delays**: Long wait times due to **overflowing storage bins** and slow processing rates.  
- **Labor Inefficiencies**: High **overtime costs** due to the inability to process wet berries overnight.  
- **Grading Inaccuracies**: Manual berry grading misclassifies up to 50% of **premium-grade berries**, leading to financial losses.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Recommendations  

### **1️⃣ Challenges & Bottlenecks**  
- **Wet Berry Drying Bottleneck**: With **70% of cranberries being wet-harvested**, the **dryers (600 bbl/hr capacity) limit overall throughput**.  
- **Holding Bin Constraints**: Wet berries occupy bins **#17–24 (250 bbl each) and #25–27 (400 bbl each)**, leading to **inventory buildup and truck delays**.  
- **Truck Queue Issues**: Trucks **wait hours** due to full bins, causing leasing costs of **$100/hr per truck**.  
- **Overtime & Labor Costs**: Seasonal workers earn **1.5× overtime pay**, significantly increasing labor costs.  
- **Manual Grading Errors**: **50% of berries classified as premium are misgraded**, leading to **$337,500 in overpayments** annually.  

### **2️⃣ Proposed Solutions**  

#### ✅ **Short-Term Recommendations**  
1. **Convert Dry Bins for Wet Berry Storage**  
   - Cost: **$10,000 per bin** (Convert 2–4 bins).  
   - Benefit: Increases **wet berry holding capacity**, reducing truck wait times and overtime.  

2. **Automate Grading with a Light Meter System**  
   - Cost: **$40,000 + $15,600 annual operator salary**.  
   - Benefit: **Prevents misclassification**, saving **$200,000+ annually**.  

#### 🚀 **Long-Term Recommendations**  
1. **Install Two Additional Dryers**  
   - Cost: **$60,000 per dryer + $20,000 annual maintenance**.  
   - Benefit: Expands **wet berry drying capacity to 1,000 bbl/hr**, **reducing truck wait times and overtime labor costs**.  

2. **Expand Separator Line Capacity**  
   - Benefit: **Future-proofs the plant** as drying capacity increases.  
   - Prevents **new bottlenecks** at the **sorting & grading stage**.

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan  

1️⃣ **Cost-Benefit Analysis** – Evaluate feasibility of **dryer additions and bin conversions**.  
2️⃣ **Gradual Expansion** – Implement **bin conversions first**, followed by **dryer installations**.  
3️⃣ **Process Automation** – Introduce **light meter grading** to eliminate **misclassification errors**.  
4️⃣ **Performance Monitoring** – Track **labor efficiency, truck queue times, and processing rates** to measure improvement.  

---

## 📌 Conclusion  
By **expanding drying capacity, optimizing bin usage, and automating grading**, **NCC can eliminate bottlenecks, reduce costs, and improve processing efficiency** at Receiving Plant #1. These improvements will allow NCC to **handle increased wet berry volumes efficiently while reducing labor and transportation expenses**.
