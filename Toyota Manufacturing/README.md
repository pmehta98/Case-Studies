# üöó Toyota Motor Manufacturing, U.S.A. Case Study Analysis  

## üìå Overview  
This repository contains an **operational analysis of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, U.S.A. (TMM)**, focusing on **Toyota Production System (TPS) principles**, process inefficiencies, and defect management. The study evaluates **quality control challenges, supplier collaboration, and production line optimization**, providing strategic recommendations for Toyota‚Äôs Georgetown, Kentucky plant.  

The analysis is based on the case study:  
**"Toyota Motor Manufacturing, U.S.A." ‚Äì Harvard Business School Case by Kazuhiro Mishina.**

## üéØ Case Study Summary  
TMM's **Georgetown plant** faced a **seat defect issue** that led to growing numbers of incomplete vehicles being stored in an overflow parking area. Despite Toyota‚Äôs **Just-In-Time (JIT) and Jidoka principles**, the company **allowed defective cars to continue down the production line**, deviating from TPS best practices.  

### **Key Issues Identified**  
- **Seat Defect Bottleneck**: Increasing numbers of Camrys were moved **off-line** due to seat mismatches and defects.  
- **Supplier Issues (Kentucky Framed Seat - KFS)**: KFS struggled with growing seat **variation complexity**, leading to **incorrect deliveries and delays**.  
- **Deviation from Toyota‚Äôs Jidoka Principle**: Instead of stopping the line, Toyota **allowed defects to pass**, increasing **off-line repairs and inefficiencies**.  
- **Hidden Costs & Production Inefficiencies**:  
  - Off-line inventory buildup caused **delays and increased labor costs**.  
  - **Mismatch issues** resulted in KFS sending **incorrect seat replacements**, causing rework.  
  - **Root causes were ignored** instead of being fixed at the source.

## üîç Key Insights & Recommendations  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Addressing the Seat Defect Bottleneck**  
- **Stop the Assembly Line for Seat Defects**:  
  - Aligns with **Jidoka (automation with a human touch)**, ensuring **problems are fixed at the source**.  
  - Reduces **off-line repairs**, saving labor hours and lowering defect resolution time.  

- **Improve Supplier Collaboration (KFS)**:  
  - Increase **real-time communication** to prevent **seat mismatches**.  
  - Implement **pre-shipment verification** to **reduce incorrect deliveries**.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Enhancing Toyota Production System (TPS) Practices**  
- **Kaizen for Continuous Improvement**:  
  - Perform **root cause analysis (Five Whys Methodology)** to prevent **recurring seat defects**.  
  - Introduce **automated defect tracking systems** for supplier accountability.  

- **Optimizing Production Flow**:  
  - Implement **better tracking for defective vehicles** to ensure **faster rework turnaround**.  
  - Train assembly workers to identify **seat issues earlier in the process**.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Long-Term Operational Improvements**  
- **Introduce Automated Seat Inspection**:  
  - Reduce defect rates **before installation** using **real-time quality sensors**.  
- **Redesign Seat Hooks to Prevent Breakage**:  
  - Invest in **stronger material for rear seat hooks** to reduce **installation failures**.
